# Rutgers Physics 610: Interstellar Matter
## John F. Wu 

My notes for the class are found in the home directory (`ism.tex` and `ism.pdf`)~~, and my completed homework assignments live in the `./homework` directory.~~.

This course (ISM for short) was taught in Fall 2015 by Eric Gawiser, and is based on lecture notes by Andrew J. Baker. The primary textbook is by Bruce T. Draine - Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium (2011); much of the content and many of the figures are borrowed from there. Also relevant in the latter half of the course is The Physics of Astrophysics Volume II: Gas Dynamics by Frank H. Shu (1992).

I strive for, but do not guarantee, scientific (or grammatical) accuracy in these personal notes. If you find any errors, please let me know via [email](mailto:jfwu@physics.rutgers.edu).
