# Rutgers Physics 610: Interstellar Matter
## John F. Wu 

My notes for the class are found in the home directory (`ism.tex` and `ism.pdf`), and my completed homework assignments live in the `./homework` directory.

These are my notes on the Rutgers graduate level course on interstellar matter (ISM; although this abbreviation is usually reserved for interstellar medium). This course was taught in Fall 2015 by Eric Gawiser, and based on lecture notes by Andrew J. Baker. The primary textbook is by Bruce T. Draine - Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium (2011). Also relevant in the latter half of the course is The Physics of Astrophysics Volume II: Gas Dynamics by Frank H. Shu (1992).

I strive for, but do not guarantee, scientific (or grammatical accuracy) in these personal notes. If you find any errors, please let me know via ([mailto:jfwu@physics.rutgers.edu](email)).
